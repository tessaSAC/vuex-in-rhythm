# vuex-in-rhythm

## TODOS:
- Integrate the location from Vuex into TheTargetDiv
- Figure out why location/DISPATCH_ACTION does not exist
- Use a ref on TheTargetDiv to position TheCompanionDiv to its right at all times
- Import the ref into Vuex so any location changes are reactive

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install || yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev || yarn run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build || yarn run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
